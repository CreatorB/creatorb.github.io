<p>Hi! there, i’m Hasan Basri having more than XXX years of experience as a Android Developer. I started in 2013 with Eclipse ADT and coded simple apps, forced to move to Android Studio when Google stopped it’s support. My major strength lies in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android development stack with ability to adapt and thrive with new technologies and environments (Content Providers, Services, Location and Sensors, AdMob).</li>
<li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.</li>
<li>Work with outside data sources and APIs (Material Design, Volley/Retrofit/FastAndroidNetworking).</li>
<li>Continuously discover, evaluate, and implement new technologies to maximize development efficiency.</li>
<li>Work on bug fixing and improving application performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require any of above mentioned work then do let me know and I will shortly share my plan regarding that work. Thanks.</p>
