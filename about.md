 Hi! there, i'm Hasan Basri having more than XXX years of experience as a Android Developer. I started in 2013 with Eclipse ADT and coded simple apps, forced to move to Android Studio when Google stopped it's support. My major strength lies in:	

 - Android development stack with ability to adapt and thrive with new technologies and environments (Content Providers, Services, Location and Sensors, AdMob). 	
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.	
- Work with outside data sources and APIs (Material Design, Volley/Retrofit/FastAndroidNetworking).	
- Continuously discover, evaluate, and implement new technologies to maximize development efficiency.	
- Work on bug fixing and improving application performance.	

 If you require any of above mentioned work then do let me know and I will shortly share my plan regarding that work. Thanks.
